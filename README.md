- Description: Users will be able to search for target muscle groups and get results of workouts relating to that target area. Users who have logged in will be able to add set numbers for their desired target areas and build a workout for the day. They will be able to see their previous workout as a reminder when they are filling out their current workout, as well as view all of their previous sessions on the profile page. 

- Technical Requirements:
    - App runs on Flask server written in Python 
    - Postgres Database used to persist data- users, workouts, show last workout
    - User login- Flask login
    - REST API Integration- Exercises by API-Ninjas: search for workout examples from requested target area

- Things we enjoyed:
    - We enjoyed the freedom we had to develop an idea of our own. We got to use whatever specs we wanted to fit the ideas that we came up with. It was nice having a project with less specific requirments so that we could build what worked for us.
    - We also enjoyed how similar the set up of the project was to our individual projects. A lot of the code was the same and it only took a little bit of effort looking into how to use the API and set up our db like we wanted. The project was the right amount of challenge while still allowing us to be creatively free.

- Things we didn't enjoy:
    - When we started the project, we had way too many ideas than what we ended up with. We had to get rid of some of the things that we wanted in order to just make an MVP of our workout planner
    - We're going to continue to work on this app and deveklope it further to include more of the features that we wanted in the beginning, such as saving workout move titles, weights, personal records, and more. It was hard to not go fully into all of these ideas for the initial project, but we had to settle for something more simpler to turn in for the grade.
